                  Welcome to T3 Chat! Your use of our services, including the services we make available through this website and all related web sites, mobile sites, data files, visualizations and applications which link to these terms of service (the "Site") and to all software or services offered by us in connection with any of those (collectively, the "Services"), is governed by these terms of service (the "Terms"), so please carefully read them before using the Services.

If you are registering for these Services on behalf of an organization, you agree that you are also responsible for the actions of your Authorized Users and for any User Content that such Authorized Users might upload, record, publish, post, link to, or otherwise transmit or distribute through use of the Services. By storing User Content with T3 Chat, you represent that you have all necessary rights to store, use and, if applicable, publicize that User Content, and that doing so does not conflict with, violate or misappropriate any third party legal rights, conflict with licenses you've granted to others, violate any applicable law or regulations, or any of our Terms. Our Services will allow you to share your User Content with others, which is in your sole control and discretion. You are responsible for taking appropriate steps to secure and protect your account and your User Content, such as setting up and maintaining the proper configuration and use of our Services, as well as using encryption to protect your User Content from unauthorized access when and if applicable. Please be careful about what User Content you choose to share.

T3 Chat doesn't actively monitor the User Content you upload, download or share. However, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to review and remove User Content and/or suspend your access to your account in the event we become aware that your use of our Services or User Content violate any of our Terms, or any applicable law and/or regulations (such as copyright infringement, if we learn the User Content is patently unlawful, if we learn the User Content is malware or supports the distribution of malware, etc.). We assume no liability for any User Content that you or anyone else stores with T3 Chat. You understand that User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable.

                <p>
                  Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with T3 Chat and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except for small claims disputes in which you or T3 Chat seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or claims for injunctive relief by either party, any dispute or controversy arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California under the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-307) and the then current rules of JAMS (formerly known as Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services) by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with such rules. Where arbitration is not required by these Terms, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action with respect to the subject matter of these Terms will be the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara, California, and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SALES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN YOU AND T3 Chat, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTION PROCEDURES SHALL NOT BE ASSERTED IN NOR APPLY TO ANY ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU ALSO AGREE NOT TO BRING ANY LEGAL ACTION, BASED UPON ANY LEGAL THEORY INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST T3 Chat THAT IS MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE APPLICABLE ORDER.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by emailing us at legal@t3.chat. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.
